# Ethereum Blockchain Workshop

A simple Blockchain project developing ethereum smart contracts and tests for a survey website.

<br>

## Run local development

Compile and migrate the smart contracts. Note inside the development console we don't preface commands with truffle.

```
truffle compile
truffle migrate
```

Run the liteserver development server (outside the development console) for front-end hot reloading. Smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.

Serves the front-end on http://localhost:3000

```
npm run dev
```


Once you are ready to start testing, type in the following command:

```
truffle test
```
